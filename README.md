# supply chain analytics
## Project description
This data analysis project leverages data-driven insights to pinpoint and address inefficiencies within supply chain warehouse and shipping operations. By analyzing relevant datasets and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), we aim to identify the root causes of issues such as delays and high costs. The project will deliver actionable recommendations for optimizing these critical areas and improving overall supply chain efficiency.
## Question 
1.What are the total net sales, profit and profit?

2.How do the net sales and profit change over time?

3.How do the number of orders change over time?

4.How do the average order quantity and average unit price change over time?

5.Which product departments account for the majority of net sales and number of orders?

6.How was the distribution of customers by country and market?

7.How do the warehouse inventory and storing costs change over time?

8.Which warehouses are orders shipped from? 

9.Which shipment modes are preferred by customers?

10.What is the shipping time for each shipment mode?

## Process
Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.

Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.

## Final Conclusion:
1. Supplier disruption
   
In short term
the company should focus on suppliers in the likely growing customer group in Asia, especially those that provide emerging product departments such as technology.

In the long term
the next main customer group is likely to be from North America, the company needs to take advantage of the time to redesign the supplier network to recalling old best selling departments

2. Inventory management

    a.Forecasting demand:
- Analyzing historical sales data
- Tracking market trends
- Employing predictive analytics
  
   b.Setting up controlling indicators for each product
 - Sales velocity
- Desired safety stock levels
  
3. Delay shipment
   
The  markets near the warehouse (North America, LATAM, Western Europe,...)
- Redesigned transportation route
  
The  markets far away from the warehouse (Asia Pacific, SEA,...)

- Establishing a warehouse in a strategic logistics hub like Singapore in Asia
