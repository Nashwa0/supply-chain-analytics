# supply chain analytics
## Project description
This data analysis project leverages data-driven insights to pinpoint and address inefficiencies within supply chain warehouse and shipping operations. By analyzing relevant datasets and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), we aim to identify the root causes of issues such as delays and high costs. The project will deliver actionable recommendations for optimizing these critical areas and improving overall supply chain efficiency.
